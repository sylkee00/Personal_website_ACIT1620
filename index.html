                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p class="p1">Hi there, I hope this message finds you well! I'm currently in the 1st term of the <strong>BCIT CIT</strong> program and have been in Canada for three years now. I was born in 2000 and my favorite hobby is working out. I enjoy going to the gym almost every day to stay active and healthy. I tend to be a bit introverted, but I also love spending time with my close friends and having fun. Thanks for taking the time to read a bit about me!</p>
                <p class="p2">I'm really really enjoying the CIT program so far and find the coursework challenging and rewarding. It's been a great opportunity to learn more about programming and technology, and I'm excited to see where this program will take me in the future. In my free time, I also like to read up on the latest trends in the tech industry and try out new coding projects. </p>
